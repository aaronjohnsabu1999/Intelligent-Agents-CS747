# Intelligent Agents

A collection of reinforcement learning and intelligent agents projects showcasing implementations of key algorithms and their comparative analysis. These projects were developed as part of the *CS747: Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents* course at IIT Bombay.

## Projects Included

### Bandits (`src/bandits`)

Implements and compares classical multi-armed bandit algorithms: **Îµ-greedy**, **UCB**, **KL-UCB**, and **Thompson Sampling**, along with a custom variant: **Thompson Sampling with a hint**. Each algorithm minimizes cumulative regret across different horizons and random seeds.

**Key Findings:**
- Thompson Sampling generally outperforms others in regret minimization.
- KL-UCB improves over UCB using a tighter confidence bound via binary search.
- Îµ-Greedy performs best at `Îµ â‰ˆ 0.02` â€” striking a balance between exploration and exploitation.
- The Thompson Sampling "hinted" version leverages knowledge of true means, improving early performance through a custom Beta-distribution-based selector.

Includes regret plots over multiple seeds and horizons, as well as parameter studies.

### MDP Maze Solver (`src/mdp`)

Solves mazes by modeling them as Markov Decision Processes using:
- **Value Iteration**
- **Linear Programming** (via PuLP)
- **Howardâ€™s Policy Iteration**

**Pipeline:**
1. `encoder.py` transforms grid mazes into MDPs.
2. `solver.py` computes optimal policy.
3. `decoder.py` reconstructs the shortest path using the policy.

**Insights:**
- LP is consistently fastest for large mazes.
- Howard's Policy Iteration performs well on small problems but becomes costly as maze complexity grows.
- Visual comparisons confirm that solved mazes follow intuitive paths with minimal steps.

Benchmarks for runtime across methods and visualizations for grid navigation are included.

### Windy Gridworld (`src/windy_gridworld`)

Adopts the Sutton & Barto Windy Gridworld challenge with multiple RL approaches:
- **Sarsa** (normal and Kingâ€™s moves)
- **Sarsa with stochastic wind**
- **Q-Learning**
- **Expected Sarsa**

**Key Results:**
- Sarsa with Kingâ€™s Moves converges fastest due to shorter episodes.
- Q-Learning and Expected Sarsa outperform standard Sarsa on stability and convergence.
- The stochastic wind variant adds realistic randomness but slows convergence.
- Paths from all agents are visualized for both deterministic and windy environments.

Gridworld is defined as an episodic MDP with reward shaping and stepwise convergence plotting.

## ðŸ”§ Running Experiments with `run.py`

Use the `run.py` script to run all experiments. It acts as a unified launcher for bandits, MDP solving, verification, visualization, and Windy Gridworld tasks.

Enable `--verbose` to view subprocess outputs and logs in real time.

### Bandits
```bash
python run.py --verbose bandits \
  --instance data/bandits/instances/i-1.txt \
  --algorithm thompson-sampling \
  --rseed 42 \
  --epsilon 0.1 \
  --horizon 1000
```

### MDP Maze Solver
```bash
python run.py --verbose solve_mdp \
  --grid data/mdp/grids/grid10.txt \
  --algorithm pi
```

To create a synthetic MDP file:
```bash
python run.py --verbose generate_mdp \
  --num_states 10 \
  --num_actions 5 \
  --gamma 0.95 \
  --mdptype episodic \
  --rseed 42 \
  --output_file src/mdp/tmp/generated_mdp.txt
```

To verify all default grids (10 through 100):
```bash
python run.py --verbose verify_mdp --algorithm vi
```

To verify specific grids:
```bash
python run.py --verbose verify_mdp \
  --algorithm lp \
  --grid data/mdp/grids/grid40.txt data/mdp/grids/grid50.txt
```

To visualize a grid:
```bash
python run.py --verbose visualize_mdp \
  --grid_file data/mdp/grids/grid10.txt \
  --output_file plots/mdp/grid10_unsolved.png
```

To visualize a solved grid:
```bash
python run.py --verbose visualize_mdp \
  --grid_file data/mdp/grids/grid10.txt \
  --path_file data/mdp/paths/path10.txt \
  --output_file plots/mdp/grid10_solved.png
```

### Windy Gridworld
```bash
python run.py --verbose windy --episodes 170
```
